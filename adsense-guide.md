<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-YOUR_ADSENSE_ID"
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<!-- Replace YOUR_AD_SLOT_ID with your actual ad unit ID -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-YOUR_ADSENSE_ID"
     data-ad-slot="YOUR_AD_SLOT_ID"></ins>
```

### Step 3: Create Ad Units
